\section{Introduction}
\label{}

Problem-based learning (PBL) is a pedagogical approach applied worldwide, especially in nursing and medicine courses. 

\section{Practice-based learning}
\label{}

Practice-based learning strategy starts with students learning the basics of some science in the classroom. Concomitantly or after this first learning process, students carry out visits to an organization, through which they will be able to understand organizational processes, identifying aspects of the process that need to be better managed. Students then prepare a report of the visit, describing in detail the process studied and the real problems identified. Subsequently, this information is taken to the Teacher-Facilitator. Through discussions between the teacher and the students involved, the real problems, that is, the aspects of the studied process that need to be improved, are formatted as decision problems or optimization problems. And then a bibliographic survey is carried out on problems close to the identified problem and on methodologies that are applied in the solution of these first. Then a mathematical model and a solution algorithm are developed for the identified problem and the entire solution developed is passed on to the students, who in turn will take this knowledge to the company. Students will be responsible for carrying out tests to validate the developed solution and for training the company's employees.  Once the solution proposal is validated, it is possible to invest resources for the development of a software, which can be used by the studied company and by other companies.

For a better understanding of the difference between the real problem identified by the students and the formatted problem, consider the following example: after a student has visited a company that performs the maintenance service of hospital infusion pumps and analyzed in detail the processes of this company, she identified the following real problem:

\begin{quote}
"The company is unable to correctly program the hospital pump overhaul service. There are delays in maintenance and services are not prioritized correctly."
\end{quote}

After an in-depth study of the company's processes, and extensive discussions between teacher and student, it was identified that the problem was not associated with the maintenance process, but with the scheduling of equipment collection in hospitals, maintenance and return. In this context, a new allocation and routing problem was identified, defined as 'Problem of Planning the Maintenance and Transport of Hospital Infusion Pumps'. For more details on this issue see \cite{FragaEtAl2021}.

Regarding the bibliographic survey, the teacher must identify the key words as well as what information should be sought in the consulted papers. Then, students will be able to participate in this survey, contributing to the identification of relevant works. Students should also be motivated to translate, read and understand at least one or two papers. 

Modeling can be completely performed by the teacher and then explained in detail to the students, or the teacher can explain the modeling process to the students along with some more complex constraints/functions, letting the students participate in this process. The development of the solution algorithm can also have the participation of students, as long as they have had previous training on programming or on the solution tool used (R, LINGO, MATLAB etc.). It is important to make the problem and proposed solution public, so new methods and models can be developed for the identified problem, giving space to a new branch of research. 

The developed SOLVER tests must be carried out with data from the studied company, collected by the students. It is also important that students qualify company employees to use the SOLVER. Thus, the company will be able to take better advantage of the developed tool.

This approach combines teaching, research, extension and technological development as follows: through teaching, students acquire the basic knowledge necessary for the development of research and extension activities; through the extension, students deepen their knowledge of programming, help identify new decision / optimization problem and approaches applied by the company to solve these problems and test the solutions developed, also qualifying company employees; through research, students participate in the development of solutions to identified problems; and through technological projects, students can participate in software development. Both research and extension works contribute to teaching, as they allow students to understand and expand all the content
presented in the classroom, through practice. It is important to emphasize that throughout the process the teachers involved also deepen their knowledge, which significantly improves the quality of teaching.

\section{Case study}
\label{}

The practice-based learning approach was used for teaching mathematical modeling, optimization and programming to undergraduate students of the production engineering course, as described below:

Teaching: the fundamentals of mathematical modeling and optimization can be taught to students in two different subjects: 1) Mathematical programming; and 2) Mathematical Modeling. In the first course, modeling mathematical programming problems is taught along with mathematical methods of solution. Modeling problems close to real problems can and should be motivated through case modeling exercises such as those proposed by Hillier and Lieberman (2010). In the second course, students should learn how to model standard optimization problems (e.g. allocation problems; balancing problems; routing problems; and scheduling problems) in addition to some heuristics used to solve such problems. In both courses, students must be motivated to understand and present scientific papers with the modeling of real problems.

Research: once a real problem is identified; it is necessary to carry out a vast bibliographic survey, identifying mathematical models and proposed solution approaches for problems close to the one studied, and it is necessary to develop new solution algorithms, through the
adaptation of solutions proposed in the literature. The research must be carried out through research projects, and possibly in parallel with the development of course conclusion works and scientific and technological initiation projects.

Technological: once the solution is developed and tested, it is recommended to develop a
solver, with a good graphical interface, that can be easily used by company employees. This
step can be carried out through technological projects, developed in parallel with graduation
projects for students in the technological area, and projects of technological initiation. At this
stage, it is also possible to develop partnerships with startup companies, and acquire financial
resources to support research and innovation developed within the university.
